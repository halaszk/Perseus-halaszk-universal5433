config ADJD_S311
	tristate "ADJD-S311-CR999 digital color sensor"
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Avago ADJD-S311-CR999
	 digital color light sensor.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called adjd_s311.

config SENSORS_LM3533
	tristate "LM3533 ambient light sensor"
	depends on MFD_LM3533
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the ambient light sensor
	  interface on National Semiconductor / TI LM3533 Lighting Power
	  chips.

	  The sensor interface can be used to control the LEDs and backlights
	  of the chip through defining five light zones and three sets of
	  corresponding output-current values.

	  The driver provides raw and mean adc readings along with the current
	  light zone through sysfs. A threshold event can be generated on zone
	  changes. The ALS-control output values can be set per zone for the
	  three current output channels.

config SENSORS_TSL2563
	tristate "TAOS TSL2560, TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Taos TSL2560,
	 TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called tsl2563.

config VCNL4000
	tristate "VCNL4000 combined ALS and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y here if you want to build a driver for the Vishay VCNL4000
	 combined ambient light and proximity sensor.

	 To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	 module will be called vcnl4000.

config HID_SENSOR_ALS
	depends on HID_SENSOR_HUB
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	select HID_SENSOR_IIO_COMMON
	select HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER
	tristate "HID ALS"
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the HID SENSOR
	  Ambient light sensor.

config SENSORS_CM36652_IIO
	depends on IIO
	tristate "CM366852 driver"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables proximity & light sensors using CM36652 driver.

config SENSORS_CM36652_DEFENCE_CODE_FOR_NOISE
	depends on SENSORS_CM36652_IIO
	tristate "CM366852 defence code"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables CM36652 defence code for noise.

config SENSORS_CM3323_IIO
	depends on IIO
	tristate "CM3323 driver"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you use cm3323.
	  This option enables RGB sensors using
	  Capella cm3323 device driver.

	  Say N here if you do not use cm3323.

config SENSORS_CS5032_IIO
	depends on IIO
	tristate "CS5032 driver"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables proximity & light sensors using CS5032 driver.
